                <p>On March 3, 1999 the first major release of GNOME occurred with the release of GNOME 1.0. The GIMP ToolKit (GTK+) was chosen as the base for GNOME, with major effort devoted to offering a friendly platform for developers, supporting many programming languages. There were 3 subsequent releases over the next two years in the GNOME 1.x series. One of them was 1.4 and you can test it in a Virtual Machine. <a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/misc/GNOME1.4.ova">Download it here</a>. (user: gnome / password: gnomehistory)</p>

GUADEC has been held annually since then in cities around Europe, organized by local volunteers, and has grown fivefold in size. GUADEC 2017 was held in Manchester, UK with more than 250 participants.</p>

                <p>On June 26, 2002 GNOME 2.0 was released, the culmination of major efforts with the dual objective of enhancing the user experience and dramatically improving developer productivity. GNOME 2.0 was the first release in the 2.x series, which saw 16 more releases over the next 9 years.</p>
                <p>The introduction of the Human Interface Guidelines (HIG), allowed for a more predictable and consistent interface for users. GNOME 2 also had a host of advanced accessibility features for users with disabilities along with a built-in accessibility framework for developers to meet Section 508 requirements.</p>
                <p>GNOME 2.x was widely adopted over its many iterations, though many were unhappy upon its introduction. Said one critic upon the release of GNOME 2.0: <strong>“I found this default configuration, bone-headed, at best.”</strong></p>

                <p>GNOME 3.0 was an exciting new desktop designed for today’s users and which is suited to a range of modern computing devices. GNOME’s developer technologies were substantially improved for 3.0. Modernised and streamlined, they enable developers to provide better user experiences with less time and effort.</p>
                <p>The most important goal of GNOME 3 was defined as the unification of the user experience. Many flaws were identified in the GNOME 2 desktop related to windows, workspaces and application launching, some of which were labor intensive and prone to errors. A much more holistic approach was needed to take it to the next level.</p>
                <p>GNOME 3 was met by some with very positive reactions. Said one detractor, <strong>“I forgot how beautiful and stable GNOME 2 was.”</strong></p>
